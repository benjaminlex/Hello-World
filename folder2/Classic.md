## 4. Numerical input or Text input

In a numerical input problem, learners enter numbers or a specific and relatively simple mathematical expression. Learners enter the response in plain text, and the system then converts the text to a symbolic expression that learners can see below the response field.  

The system can handle several types of characters, including basic operators, fractions, exponents, and common constants such as &quot;i&quot;. You can refer learners to &quot;Entering Mathematical and Scientific Expressions&quot; in the edX Guide for Students for more information.
